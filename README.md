# Price Recommendation for Online Sellers

E-commerce platforms today are extensively driven by machine learning algorithms, right from quality checking and inventory management to sales demographics and product recommendations, all use machine learning. One more interesting business use case that e-commerce apps and websites are trying to solve is to eliminate human interference in providing price suggestions to the sellers on their marketplace to speed up the efficiency of the shopping website or app. Thatâ€™s when price recommendation using machine learning comes to play.



## Files
Price_Rec.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
data.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
README.md: This file.



## Usage
1. To run the code in Price_Rec.ipynb, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

    a. pandas
    
    b. numpy
    
    c. sklearn
    
    d. seaborn
    
    e. matplotlib
    

2. Once you have installed these libraries, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells in sequence. The dataset used in this project is included in the repository, so you can simply download the code and data files to get started.
