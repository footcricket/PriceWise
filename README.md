# PriceWise: Smart Price Recommendations for Online Sellers 💰

E-commerce platforms today heavily rely on machine learning algorithms for various aspects, from quality checking and inventory management to sales demographics and product recommendations. An interesting business use case is the automation of providing price suggestions to sellers on e-commerce marketplaces, eliminating human interference, and enhancing the efficiency of the shopping website or app. This is where PriceWise, a smart price recommendation system using machine learning, comes into play.

## Technologies Used 🚀

This project was developed using the following technologies:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: A popular platform for interactive data science and machine learning.

2. **Python**: The programming language powering the data analysis and machine learning code.

## Files 📁

1. `PriceWise.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. `PriceWise.py`: Python file containing the code for the project.
3. `data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Usage 📊

1. To run the code in `PriceWise.ipynb`, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

    a. `pandas`
    
    b. `numpy`
    
    c. `sklearn`
    
    d. `seaborn`
    
    e. `matplotlib`

2. Once you have installed these libraries, open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells in sequence. The dataset used in this project is included in the repository, so you can simply download the code and data files to get started.
